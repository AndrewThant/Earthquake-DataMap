# EarthQuake Visualizator

This project is inspired by one of the challenges of [Dan Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). I recreated this project as an exercise and all the credit goes to Dan Shiffman. The project displays earthquake data on a world map, utilizing API calls and rendering a 2D map, making it a good project for practicing web development skills.
